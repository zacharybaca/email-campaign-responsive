# Notes

- The Desktop Version Works Fine, however, I had to use the developer tools within Firefox in order to test the mobile version. For some reason when I did resize the browser window, it wasn't corresponding to the viewport.

- As shown in the screenshots, I had a little trouble getting the contact us links and social icons to align properly. I was able to do everything else for the mobile design though.
